*Estimated Time: Self-paced*

The following activities are designed for self-directed learning after completing the AI Fluency: Framework and Foundations course.

Choose the ones that resonate with your interests and needs—or use them as inspiration to create your own!

## Build a personal AI fluency plan

With the help of an AI assistant, create a structured plan for developing your AI fluency over time:

1. Current Competency Assessment
   * For each of the 4D competencies, rate your current level of proficiency (novice, developing, confident)
   * Document specific strengths and areas for growth within each competency
   * Identify which ways of AI interacting (Automation, Augmentation, Agency) you currently use most and least effectively
2. Development Priority Identification
   * Select 1-2 competencies to focus on developing first
   * Identify specific aspects of these competencies that would be most valuable in your context
   * Consider which ways of AI interaction you want to become more proficient with
3. Specific Action Planning
   * Create specific activities to develop each priority competency
   * Establish a timeline and frequency for practice sessions
   * Identify resources and tools to support your development
   * Define how you'll recognize progress and success

Work with Claude as a thinking partner in this process, sharing your self-assessments and getting feedback on your plan.

## Build a personal prompt & pattern library

Create a personalized collection of effective prompts and patterns for your recurring AI interactions with the help of Claude:

1. Common Task Template Creation
   * Identify 5-10 tasks you regularly perform with AI
   * For each task, develop a template prompt that consistently produces good results
   * Include placeholders or notes for variable information you'll need to add each time
2. Effective Strategy Documentation
   * Document specific Description techniques that work well for different types of tasks
   * Record Discernment patterns that help you evaluate outputs more effectively
   * Note which approaches work best for different interaction modes
3. Personal Reference Resource Building
   * Organize your templates and strategies in a way that’s easy to search and access
   * Include examples of successful outputs for reference
   * Create a system for updating your library as you discover new effective approaches

You can work with Claude to analyze your past successful interactions and identify patterns that made them effective.

## Game night!

These playful exercises for both you and Claude help you practice precise Description and sharpen your Discernment skills through word puzzles. Since puzzles have specific instructions (unlike open-ended tasks like "draft a thank-you note"), they're excellent for practicing clear communication. And because they're deliberately tricky, they provide great Discernment workouts! You can learn a lot about careful evaluation guidance of AI thinking processes by just playing a few games. Try any or all of the below.

#### Swap Riddles

Create a riddle (or try this one: "Five-score and more drums I tap to paint a symphony of light. What am I doing?").

(*Answer: I am typing on a computer keyboard (usually 104 keys) to create pixels on a monitor.*)

Have Claude guess, and, importantly, explain its reasoning.

Take note of not just what Claude guesses, but why.

Then don’t give it the answer, but rather gently nudge Claude towards the right chain-of-thought and context to get to the answer.

Then switch sides and ask for a riddle in return. Have Claude guide you as you did it.

#### Co-operative crosswords

Work on crossword clues together (cryptic crossword clues can be especially interesting).

The focus is not about how good you or Claude are at doing the crossword. It's about learning to guide and refine thinking: “Remember, it’s only 5 letters” “No can’t be that because it starts with B” “Maybe they didn’t mean “swallow” like drink, maybe they mean “swallow” like the bird.”

These steering skills will prove surprisingly useful in a “real” project.

#### Word association

Word association games are very satisfying and informative to play with Claude (or a model of your choice). There are many games freely available online, just have a search!

Even just picking 12 - 20 random words and collaborating with Claude to find relationships between them can be great Discernment practice. When you notice Claude making questionable connections or overlooking promising patterns, point this out and guide it toward better reasoning. Similarly, be open to Claude spotting connections you might miss!

As you collaborate, practice all three types of Discernment:

* **Product Discernment**: Do the answers make logical sense and truly fit a cohesive theme?
* **Process Discernment**: Howdoes Claude approach solving the puzzle? Does it consider multiple possibilities? Does it focus too narrowly on one interpretation?
* **Performance Discernment**: How does Claude communicate its thinking? Is it clear? Does it ask good questions? Does it build on your suggestions effectively?

#### More game suggestions

Continue developing your Description and Discernment skills through these activities:

* **Twenty Questions:** Have Claude think of an object, person, or concept, then try to guess it by asking yes/no questions. Then switch roles. Notice how you each formulate questions and provide clues.
* **Collaborative Storytelling:** Start a story with one sentence, have Claude continue with another, and alternate back and forth. Observe how you both maintain narrative coherence and build on each other's ideas.
* **A Wizard Approaches You in the Tavern:** If you enjoy playing role playing games, try playing a game or two with a language model as either player or game master.
* **Concepts & Constraints:** Choose a complex concept and really tight constraints like “explain using cooking metaphors only.” Then ask Claude to give you a challenge, try it yourself, and compare approaches.
* **Advanced Puzzling:** Create your own logic or word puzzles, then challenge Claude to solve it. Alternatively, ask Claude to create puzzles for you to solve. (If you are a programmer, you can swap out the puzzles and instead tackle thorny problems like <https://projecteuler.net/> with Claude).
