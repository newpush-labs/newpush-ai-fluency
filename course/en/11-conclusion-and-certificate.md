*Estimated Time: 15 minutes*

## Putting it all together

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Consolidate key learnings from the course
* Connect AI Fluency to your continuing development

## Video: Conclusion

*(6 minutes)*

This concluding video revisits the AI Fluency Framework and brings together the key concepts explored throughout the course. We recap the four core competencies (the 4Ds): Delegation (deciding what work to do with AI versus independently), Description (communicating effectively with AI), Discernment (evaluating AI outputs and behaviors), and Diligence (ensuring responsible AI collaboration). We emphasize that these competencies apply across all three major ways of interacting with AI (Automation, Augmentation, and Agency) and that fluency develops through practice, not overnight mastery. We close with a reminder that AI systems are powerful but not magical solutions; they’re only as useful and safe as we enable them to be through our thoughtful engagement.

#### Key takeaways

* AI Fluency develops through intentional practice of the four core competencies
* Delegation emphasizes that our expertise and judgment remain the foundation of effective AI collaboration
* Description involves clear communication that bridges our intentions and AI capabilities
* Discernment requires thoughtful and critical evaluation of outputs to work within the systems constraints
* Diligence ensures accountability, transparency, and responsibility in our AI work
* The most powerful outcomes emerge when humans and AI build on each other's strengths
* The framework is designed to remain relevant as AI systems continue to evolve

## Exercises

### Exercise: Discuss the AI Fluency Course with Claude

Engage Claude in a meaningful conversation about this course and the AI Fluency Framework (upload a copy of the framework from <https://ringling.libguides.com/ai/framework>)

Suggested conversation starters:

* "I've just completed a course on AI Fluency covering Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence. Let’s discuss how these competencies might apply to [my degree program or my job or whatever]."
* "Let's explore how the AI Fluency Framework might evolve as AI capabilities advance. What new competencies might become important in the future?" (If you do this one, reach out and let us know what you discover!)
* "Help me identify which of the 4D competencies I seem to understand well and which I might need to develop further, based on our conversation."
* “Here’s [some exercise you did in this course]. Let’s analyze it to improve my competencies.”

### Exercise: Build a Personal AI Policy

With the help of Claude, create your own guidelines for responsible and ethical AI collaboration in your personal and professional contexts:

* Create clear standards for when and how you'll work with AI in different contexts
* Establish boundaries for sensitive or confidential information
* Define how you'll maintain quality control for AI-assisted work
* Identify ethical issues most relevant to your field or activities
* Develop decision-making criteria for addressing ethical dilemmas
* Consider the perspectives of different people who might be affected by your AI interactions
* Determine how you'll disclose AI collaboration in different contexts
* Create templates for attribution and transparency statements
* Establish criteria for when more detailed disclosure is appropriate

Work with Claude as a thinking partner in this process to explore ethical considerations from multiple perspectives.

### Reflection

The exercises above serve as the reflection component for this lesson. Through them, you'll have the opportunity to consolidate your learning and connect it to your ongoing development.

#### What’s next

Congratulations on completing the AI Fluency: Framework and Foundations course! This is just the beginning of your AI Fluency journey. As AI technologies continue to evolve, the competencies you've developed in Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence, will provide a lasting framework to guide your work with these systems.

Remember that fluency develops through practice. Each interaction with AI is an opportunity to refine your skills and deepen your understanding. By approaching AI as a thinking partner rather than just a tool, and by maintaining a commitment to effectiveness, efficiency, ethics, and safety, you're well-positioned to navigate the future of human-AI collaboration.

We encourage you to continue exploring, experimenting, and reflecting on your AI interactions. There are many good additional exercises in Lesson 12 to continue your journey.

We encourage you to share what you've learned with others (and us!), seek out diverse perspectives, and contribute to the ongoing conversation about how we can work with AI in ways that amplify human potential while respecting our values and responsibilities to each other.

Thank you for your participation and engagement throughout this course!
