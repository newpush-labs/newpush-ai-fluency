## Video: Introduction to AI Fluency

*(4 minutes)*

Welcome! This video introduces you to this course’s focus: developing meaningful collaboration with AI rather than just learning about AI technology. We explain that this course explores how to build a lasting framework for working with AI systems that goes beyond simple and temporary tips and tricks. We explain what we mean by AI Fluency: it is the ability to collaborate with AI in ways that are effective, efficient, ethical, and safe. We also outline the course structure, which covers each of the AI Fluency core competencies (the 4Ds) as well as key technical and practical concepts. By the end of the course, you'll have a framework for thoughtful AI interaction, confidence in choosing when and how to work with AI effectively, practical collaboration skills, and the ability to evaluate and disseminate AI-assisted work responsibly.

#### Key takeaways

* This course focuses on human-AI collaboration, not just understanding AI as a technology
* AI Fluency means engaging with AI systems effectively, efficiently, ethically, and safely
* The AI Fluency Framework centers on the "4D" competencies of Delegation, Description, Discernment and Diligence
* The goal is to develop lasting skills that remain relevant as AI technology evolves
* Effective AI collaboration requires both practical skills and a fundamental shift in how we think about working with AI

## Exercises

### Putting things into practice

*You'll need access to a language model (5-10 mins)*

Throughout this course, you'll practice what you're learning by working directly with a language model. While our examples feature Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), you're welcome to work with any language model you prefer. The principles and skills we’ll explore apply across different AI systems.

Getting started is simple and free:

* Claude: Visit [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.169fce31-c303-4269-ad2a-e4fd757930db) to create a free account
* No paid subscriptions required to complete course activities
* You can also use other AI chatbots as you prefer

New to Claude? No worries! We'll provide clear guidance with each exercise to help you get started.

### Reflection

Before moving on, take a moment to consider your own experiences with AI:

* What challenges have you encountered when working with AI to achieve specific outcomes?
* What possibilities for AI collaboration excite you most?
* What do you hope to gain from this course?

Pro tip: you can also share this document and other course materials with Claude for help exploring specific concepts.

#### What’s next

In the next lesson, we'll explore why AI Fluency matters in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape. We’ll introduce three key ways people collaborate with AI (Automation, Augmentation, and Agency) and the core competencies of the AI Fluency Framework: the "4Ds" of Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence.
