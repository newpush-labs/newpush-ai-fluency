*Estimated Time: 20 minutes*

## What you’ll learn

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

* Apply your understanding of Delegation to a practical multi-step project you'll work on throughout the rest of this course

## Exercises

### Exercise: Project Planning and Delegation

*Estimated time: 20 minutes*

#### Step 1: Choose Your Project

Select a medium-sized, multi-step project that you can work on throughout the remainder of this course. Your project should be:

* Substantial enough to involve multiple types of tasks
* Manageable enough to complete within about 1 hour of work
* Something you're genuinely interested in creating or accomplishing

Here are some suggestions to consider:

**Communication Projects:**

* Create a compelling presentation on a topic you're knowledgeable about
* Write a post or series of posts explaining a complex topic to a general audience
* Develop a proposal or pitch for an idea you'd like to pursue
* Create a personal or professional bio with supporting materials

**Research Projects:**

* Research and summarize the current state of an emerging technology or trend
* Analyze a dataset to identify patterns and create recommendations
* Compare multiple products, services, or approaches and create a recommendation
* Investigate a historical event and present your findings in an engaging format

**Creative Projects:**

* Outline a short story with fully developed characters and plot
* Design a simple website structure with content for key pages
* Develop a concept for a product, service, or experience

**Learning Projects:**

* Create a structured learning plan for a skill you want to develop
* Build a resource collection on a topic you're learning about
* Develop a tutorial or guide for a process you understand well
* Create a set of study materials for a topic you want to master

#### Step 2: Project Vision and Goals

Start a conversation with Claude. Share your project idea and invite Claude to ask you some questions until you feel you have a solid vision for the final result. Work together until you have a clear picture of:

* What success looks like for your project
* What would make this project particularly valuable or meaningful to you

#### Step 3: Task Breakdown and Delegation Analysis

Similar to what you did in the previous lesson, work with Claude to explore your project through the lens of Delegation:

1. Identify together the major tasks needed to complete your project.
2. For each task, one at a time, discuss:
   * What specific skills, knowledge, or AI capabilities are needed?
   * Which parts would benefit from uniquely human strengths?
   * Which parts could leverage AI capabilities well?
   * Where might collaboration have the most impact?
   * *Note: Again, have a genuine conversation about these questions rather than just exchanging statements. Challenge assumptions, ask for clarification, and remain open to unexpected insights that emerge during your discussion.*
3. Create a project plan that includes your major tasks and delegation decisions.
4. Save your project plan—you'll return to this project later in the course to practice your Description, Discernment, and Diligence skills.

### Reflection

Before moving on, take a moment to consider:

* What insights emerged from your planning conversation with Claude?
* What do you anticipate will be the most challenging aspect of your delegation plan?
* What additional information or skills might help you delegate more effectively to AI?

#### What’s next

In the next lesson, we'll explore the second core competency: Description. You'll learn approaches for communicating effectively with AI systems, which will help you implement the plan you've just created. This includes techniques for defining what you want, guiding how the AI approaches the task, and specifying how you want the AI to interact with you throughout the process.
