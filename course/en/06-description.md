*Estimated Time: 15 minutes*

## What you’ll learn

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

* Understand how to effectively communicate your intentions to AI systems
* Recognize the importance of clear, purposeful communication
* Develop skills in three types of Description: Product, Process, and Performance

## Video: A Closer Look at Description

*(4 minutes)*

This video explores the Description competency of AI Fluency—the art of communicating effectively with AI systems. We explain that Description goes beyond simply writing prompts; it involves creating a collaborative environment where both you and the AI can work effectively together. We introduce three key components of Description:

* Product Description: Clearly defining what you want the AI to create
* Process Description: Guiding how the AI approaches your request
* Performance Description: Defining how you want the AI to behave during your collaboration.

We also emphasize that AI can't read your mind, and how the quality of your results often comes down to how clearly you articulate your needs, preferred approach, and desired interaction style.

#### Key takeaways

* Description is about communicating with AI in ways that create a productive collaborative environment
* Product Description involves clearly defining what you want in terms of outputs, format, audience, and style
* Process Description guides how the AI approaches your request, which can be as important as specifying the end goal
* Performance Description defines behavioral aspects like whether the AI should be concise or detailed, challenging or supportive
* AI systems are interactive partners, not databases or vending machines
* Clear communication up front saves time and leads to better results

## Exercises

### Exercise: Bad Prompt Makeover

*Estimated time: 10 minutes*

**Instructions:**

1. Ask Claude to challenge you with some poorly written prompts for you to improve.
2. Apply your Description thinking to improve each one, considering:  
   - Clear product description (what exactly you want)  
   - Process guidance (how you want Claude to approach it)  
   - Performance specifications (how you want Claude to behave during your collaboration)
3. Have a chat about the before/after versions with Claude and ask for feedback on how your improved descriptions would help it provide better responses.
4. After about 5 minutes, switch roles and provide bad prompts for Claude to fix. Notice what information Claude tends to add and how it organizes this information.

### Reflection

Before moving on, take a moment to consider:

* Which component of Description (product, process, or performance) do you think you might be overlooking in your current AI interactions?
* Think about a recent AI interaction that didn't quite meet your expectations. How might better description skills have improved the outcome?

#### What’s next

Next we head to Deep Dive 2: "Effective Prompting Techniques", which is a practical technical lesson builds directly on what you've just learned about Description, providing specific techniques, examples, and frameworks for crafting effective prompts across different scenarios. The prompting skills you'll develop in this deep dive will significantly enhance your ability to communicate with AI systems and improve the quality of your collaborations, now and into the future.
